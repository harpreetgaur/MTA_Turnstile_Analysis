# MTA_Turnstile_Analysis
Collaborated on this project to do some Turnstile analysis by using a web scraper 

The purpose of the project was to use a webscraper and conduct Data Analysis and provide visualization on the MTA usage in New York City

NYC MTA Turnstile Usage Dataset
Have a look at / download the following dataset :
- Go to http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html
- This dataset shows entry & exit counter values for each turnstile-device in each station in the NYC Subway System.
- Note these aren’t counts per interval, but equivalent to an “odometer” reading for each device.

Please reference Project.ipnyb or Project.html for the analysis code.

The Remote-Booth-Station file was required to do the analysis, this can be found on the MTA website as well.
